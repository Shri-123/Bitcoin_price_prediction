# Bitcoin_price_prediction
Data Science project in R programming language

This R-based data science project focuses on forecasting the closing price of Bitcoin and presenting comprehensive price trends. We leverage crucial input variables, namely the opening price, daily high, and low prices, to make accurate predictions. To accomplish this, we employ sophisticated machine learning techniques, including Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest Algorithm, and Support Vector Regression (SVR).

In addition to prediction accuracy, we emphasize visual representation to enhance comprehension. We create visually appealing graphs that vividly illustrate the actual and projected price trends. By incorporating these visual aids, users can easily discern the patterns and fluctuations within the Bitcoin market.
